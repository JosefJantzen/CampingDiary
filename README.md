# CampingDiary
CampingDiary is an android diary app, especially for your camping trips around the world with a van or motorhome. <br>
I developed the app quite some time ago, with the purpose to extend my knowledge in Java and bigger projects. The focused was more on the development acspects in Java and the functionality of the app rather then creating a very pretty user interface. <br>
The app isn't 100% complete but can already be used and I reached anyway all my learning goals.<br>
You can find all the todos [here](#todos).

The app is completely written in Java and uses Room (SQLite) as a local database. <br>

## Brief overview
The main page of the app gives you an overview during your trip. The app tracks where you spent your night and all the fun events you did, like sightseeing, hiking, etc. but also things like fueling, supply and disposal of your camping car and your mileage. In addition there is an overview of the money you spent in all the different types of activities during your trip.<br><br>

The creation of a trip looks like the following and is pretty similar to creating all the other things in the app e.g. an event<br><br>

All the overview pages give you the most important informations about the event. The overview of the nights looks like the following screenshot<br><br>
